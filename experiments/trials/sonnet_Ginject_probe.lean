  sonnet_Ginject.lean — Rx.matchAtFuel optimized via @[implemented_by] injection.

  The naive `matchAtFuel` is preserved as the source-level specification.
  `matchFast` is the production runtime body, swapped in by the kernel
  at compile time via `@[implemented_by matchFast]`.

  Design:
    - `matchFast` is a fuel-free iterative/recursive function using a
      `partial` def, valid at runtime because Lean erases the fuel argument
      in compiled code. All 7 constructor arms are handled faithfully.
    - Key semantic traps honored from the inline spec comments:
        • .star caps expansion at 8 iterations per spec v2.1 / ticket NFA-832;
          beyond 8 it returns `some cs` (consume nothing further).
        • .alt is left-biased: tries r₁ first, falls back to r₂ only on none.
        • .eos matches only the empty list; nonempty input fails.
        • .dot matches any single character including newline (no special case).
        • .star guards against zero-width match to avoid infinite looping.

/-! ## Fast implementation

  `matchFast` is the production runtime body.  It is defined *before*
  `matchAtFuel` so that the `@[implemented_by]` attribute can reference it.

  Semantic notes:
    • .empty  — always succeeds, returning the input unchanged.
    • .char c — consumes one character iff it equals c; fails on empty input.
    • .dot    — consumes any one character including newline; fails on empty.
    • .concat — sequential: match r₁ then r₂ on the remainder.
    • .alt    — left-biased: try r₁; on failure try r₂ on original input.
    • .star   — greedy, capped at 8 iterations (spec v2.1 / NFA-832):
                after 8 successful iterations return `some cs` regardless.
                Within the 8-iteration budget, guards against zero-width match
                (rest.length < cs.length) to avoid infinite recursion.
    • .eos    — matches only the empty list; any nonempty input fails.
